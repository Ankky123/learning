1. If a validation can be applied on input and worksheet change event, then it should be applied there
2. If a validation has dependenies that are efore or after it, it should be applied on validate call
3. Mandatory check should be applied on validate call
3. There is no need to apply fmsgbox -> just use msgbox, If a common string like schedule name is to be used,
	use a string to add the messages to that will be initiated on the call of validate button
4. Messages should come in order of the fields so that an updated entry will not cause contradictory messages
5. Worksheet Change can be called manually

6. Prohibited/Invalid entries should be blocked at key stroke level

If Application.intersect is inside the sub, we get info of it being called in worksheet change but it is useless at any place
	-> But we can pass the range and call the sub and it will show intended changes
If application.intersect is outside the sub, we cannot get info of where is it being called, so changing something can trigger unexpected consequences

Correcting some issue in the code may generate another issue and this cycle can continue
