SIT-62346 -> Updated
SIT-62516 -> Updated
BA -> SIT-62489 -> The updated requirement is invalid (Primary v/s Secondary) (HP -> type of HP)
BA -> SIT-62583 -> Mapping logic is still missing, (Primary v/s Secondary) (Select account for credit) requesting BA/prefill technical team to provide proper mapping logic for import.
BA -> SIT-62582 -> Updated -> Discussion Required -> (Logic column issue) Since required logic is updated in Prefill Source column, it will create issues, can't accept such clarification
BA -> SIT-62357 -> Updated -> Discussion Required -> (First time filing flag??) -> Prefill Source Column is not for ADP reference as per discussions with prefill team, this is Infy's internal mapping.
						ADP would require a logic in the prefill json field based on the schema fields. But a comment is provided, based on which incomplete prefill can be done.
	Since the Prefill Source/Logic column is not for specific offline util reference by ADP, it would be great if the prefill import logic is provided in a new column or in the primary
	Prefill json field

for now, making for 115B as independent

bus income can be adjusted with -> same CFL loss  and remaining 115B loss     
                                   -> bus loss form CFL and (115B loss from CFL - (income of 115B ))

looks like a circular reference

                                   -> specul loss form CFL  and (bus loss from CFL - (bus loss that is set off with bus inc )) 
)))

specif income can be adjusted with -> same CFL loss         and remaining business loss
                                   -> specif loss form CFL  and (bus loss from CFL - (bus loss that is set off with (bus inc + specul inc))

We use two repositories 
1. CreateUIMap
2. E-Filing-Sandbox

Steps
1. Make sure the branch in the CreateUIMap is as per correct ay (master_ay)
2. Pull the branch for its ay (if never done or if instructed to do so again)
3. Pull the dev_merge
4. Update the env.json file as per the type of work and proper folder location
5. Make sure the RuleAuthors are in correct ay folder and updated
6. Make sure the branch in the E-Filing-Sandbox is as per correct ay (internal_merge_sanity_ay)
7. Pull the branch for its ay
8. In CreateUIMap -> go run. ITRx
9. In E-Filing-Sandbox -> npm start


first update CreateUIMap as per the AY then pull dev_merge on it (first time users will need to pull master_ay before pulling dev_merge)

Prior AY ITR5 Update Tips
Critical Assumption -> If a change is mentioned, it is with respect to the AY 23-24 (for both the AYs -> 22-23 and 21-22)
To delete an element from the RA if it is removed from the schema, this element will then be removed from everywhere else
if change is mentioned, then make according to the provided sheet 
error messages are to be done from the DE sheet
In change sheet if change is done ->Green
				if no change required -> yellow
				if discussion required or pending for other reasons -> red
Important Notes
Schedule VDA is deleted
To have a look at TCS -> Done
To see if there is any change in the DPM/DOA for Prior AY wrt 23-24 in the change sheet


Now implement the changes of the latest RA -> then look at the red points and schedule a discussion if required
then move on to the 21-22

1. 153C to be removed from PAG in ITR5

CollapsibleDisplay??

Contact -> Editing page, we want two fields in one row but only 1 is coming -> Not an issue
B1. Income from Salary (Need space below) -> Done
Type of house property issue rowfield in NE and clubbed in editing -> rowfield -> Done

Amt deemed to be STCG -> radio is not saving


What to do now
ITR4 enhancement tickets
ITR5 21-22 Pending
Enhancement -> ITR5, ITR7
ITR6 Submission today
ITR1 and ITR4 proper testing -> Done
	ITR1 log prefill issue
	ITR4 enhancement tickets for prefill
	Will be done tomorrow (today will be for ITR6)

AY 21-22 DEF/PFA 3, 5, 6, 7 (last)

Goal
Enhancement builds with JIRA tickets to be submitted for all AYs, all ITRs

ITR1 and ITR4 testing
ITR1
Bank account is not getting deleted -> Done
When error messages are shown, alignment is getting unset
OS amount field to change alignment to right
Sl.No. with checkbox is not yet reduced
80U default dropdown

ITR4
Amount not coming -> Resolved

ITR3
CG - 198 -> Display
CG - 404 -> 1301 GroupID
CG - 412 -> 1301 GroupID
P&L -> demo the UI
DPM-DOA -> Require the finalized requirements, also vernacularity for dynamic error message

ITR2 
OS -> Label issue in DTAA table (E_R_Table) -> Done

To put conditions in the CFL -> ITR2 and ITR3 -> Done

Prefill v/s default

Primary V/S secondary fields -> Will lead to multiple elements addition
	If both are available, we will import the primary fields and ignore the secondary fields
For schduleHP and bank details there are two different primary fields, so we need a point of comparison for a unique mapping
Multiple primary field reference for an array -> Will lead to multiple elements addition
	HP (array -> array)
		source1 -> form26as
			an array element will be made and imported
		source2 -> lastfiledITR
			an array element wil be made and imported

Import Utility
	one array element with inputs from both the sources -> Not feasible


New errors as sent by Harini for the enhancement build -> Most points are for Manisha
ITR7 will be prioritized by me


ITR2 build to be shared for 22-23 for internal testing
ITR7 build to be shared to infy

Enhancemcents ITR2 Prefill
bankaccount details might not be working for two sources


delete bank account issues -> Working in v2 builds

Works to do------------------
DPM-DOA enhancement for the user value and computed value
