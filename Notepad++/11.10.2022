How to validate a field in the html
E.g. -> First Name
	max length allowed is 25 characters
	numbers not allowed
	it is not mandatory
	
I will have an ID for the field
	using the ID, I will need to navigate the map of UserInputValues to find the validation fields and function to call for the field
	The submit button will be called to call the all the validations
	the ID needs to be map navigable
	need to use javascript getelementbyid() inside the submit button function for all the fields
	This idea can be extended to every field for group id also and other formulas and functions

frist lets add submit button in the html page
then add a simple validation automatically

to generate a file including all the elements ids
to add the parameter in the function of insert field
to add the parameter in the function of insert table
parent id -> To remove "struct" from the string
