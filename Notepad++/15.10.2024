Half Day leave/WFH

If an employee's biometric is available it will be taken into consideration for pay (by amount of hours), (WFH from auxilio will be considered due to half days)
If an employees' biometric is not available, the approval of leave or WFH will be considered from Auxilio
WFH needs reports

As such,
if any employee is taking half day leave, it will be considered from biometric because the employee was/would be in the premises via biometric record
if any employee is taking WFH for half day (after coming to premises), a WFH request must be raised followed by WFH report

version varialbe in config file will be compared with api response of the latest version
if the version will not match with the response, upgrade to new version will be enabled
if version matches, only "continue" button will be enabled which will open the utility available in the folder with the name that is set in mainApp variable in config

backend call > This backend call will determine which button to show out of the two
	zip > mainApp zip file
	version > mainApp version latest

To make an installer using NSIS to combine the three files of the folder.

Release notes  : 
Regex of the mainApp variable should be follow that of exe(s). i.e. <pretext><version><posttextwithextension>
This will be followed for individual environment (the build of the ITRs) i.e. ITR1-4, will follow a constant pretext, 

Icon to be updated for all the build branches

Release notes  : 
The "ITR-eFiling_Installer" will install the auto-updater in the location "$LOCALAPPDATA\ITR-eFiling"
The folder structure for the installation directory will be 
ITR-eFiling
	>config.json
	>ITR_EFiling 23-24 1-4 v1.0.49ENX.exe (the current latest version submitted along with every installer)
	>ITR-eFiling.exe
	>uninstall.exe

On successfull installation of the setup, user will be able to open the auto-update window via the shortcut icon and through installed programs list in the windows startup menu
For further flow, please refer the requirement documentation

Important : Since the API call to the Infosys server returns the latest available version for the utility, it is imperative that the latest submitted file is uploaded on the file server and the version key is updated accordingly for expected flow.
