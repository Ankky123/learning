JIRA Issues are not filterable by "Section Details"
Section details are supposed to be only 2 types for proper filtering
Screen shots are unclear
AY Categorisation not avaiable in the Excel defects
Will let you know any more issues

"Actual" and "expected" are not following a standard

Some Issues -> The description is not given properly and not mentioning actual and expected values
Some Issues screenshots are missing
Request BAs to vet the issues.

SIT-46957

DE reference is missing in many defects
Incorrect sub-categorisation of the issues (label issues mentioned as error message issue)
Please sanitize the issues for fast closure
Defects raised are not actionable
10 defects per AY for Current AY

Incremental build will be given on the stable build
Prior AY Regression testing was not completed due to which now blockers are coming

Approach and Requirement has changed -> Utility level validations and Upload level validations are now asked differently
If it is massive effort for you, it will be even bigger effort from our side, your team has test cases scenarios, jsons, utilities

more people -> we will have to bring more number of people

not expected from our team, Rajendra has to take a call -> he has set different expectations for your teams and our teams
