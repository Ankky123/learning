Legacy Issues - The issues are not a part of DE 23-24 change requirements and didn't come due to changes made by our team in the utility. 
	Legacy issues are out of our coverage of the utility and we will not be resolving them. 
	I am sorry, our team has their hand filled up with the upcoming submissions and current AY issues.
	Their severity is high ? 
	The utility was in production with these issues and it didn't cause any problem while its duration cannot be considered high 
	We have limited resources that 
there is only 1 current AY issue that is to be resolved
Other current AY issues are not issues per se, but are changes that were added to change sheet later on.
