change-map -> changeValidation -> getWarning(elem.id,1) -> id to be replaced by name
assesee rep flag is not visible


1. showData -> Uncomment -> ChangeValidation testing -> done
2. Radio button changeValidation Verification -> Working -> done
3. getData -> same page array values to be used
4. showData functionality verification
5. Formula Verification
6. IsMandatory and IsEditable verification
7. IsAvailable to modify


ValidateSheet will put error at all the places where error is
if the element value is blank, check whether if mandatory is true/false for the current field -> Get the error and move forward
if err is blank from previous step then only check the changeValidations for the current field -> Get the error and move forward
if err is blank from the previous step then only check the saveValidations for the current field -> Get the error and move forward

if err is not blank, then set the error for the current field

due to different kind of fields, there might arise various issues, 

if (Object is conditional Mandatory, also make it conditional available)

output -> if enum exists, return the key for the given value

Dear Team,

A gentle reminder.
Still not able to connect to JIRA with the MSP ID : MSP02162998.

Also 3 other MSP IDs credentials are not received yet. (MSP02162999, MSP02163005, MSP02163006).

@Rajendra V. Shanbhogue, Team will not be able to follow through your comment since VPN poses a hard bottleneck for the development.

Thanks,
Ankit

"Production Support ADP" <production_support_91@arundataprocessing.co.in>


Why the getData(), getEnum() is being called frequently?? without any event trigger??
getData() in the map.service.ts has return statement on the first line that is not commented why??
getData() in the json.service.ts is getting jm as undefined always (false alarm) console shows a value

PartB_TTI.Refund.BankAccountDtls.AddtnlBankDetails -> This ids getData() seems wrong
