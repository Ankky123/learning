Point to throw

During development we noticed that one same pincode is referring to two different state codes.
The validation rules are inconsistent here.
Please clarify as what validation to apply in this case and also give us a list of such pincodes.


, AMT.DeductClaimSec6A=0

OR(AMT.AdjustedUnderSec115JC <=2000000, AMT.DeductClaimSec6A=0)

To make the schema of ITR7 23-24
it will have to be made on a base version
Get a base version
first make new schedules, (decide names) (Required or not will be decided later)
then add new fields, (decide names)
then remove old fields

Mail to Ayushi about amt issue that pincode will be 

to add schema change, Previous Schema, Current Schema column in ITR7 Status Tracker Only (This will be the mapping document)
Mapping will have to be done at the earliest by Ishita
Chirag -> ITR7 Utility
Ishita -> Schema Mapping

Ishita Tomorrow -> 170A of 20-21 -> ITR4 Completion and Issues -> ITR 7 Schema Mapping -> ITR5 Continue
Chirag -> ITR2 Issues -> ITR6 import generate -> ITR7 Continue
Satyaprakash -> ITR1 Issues -> ITR3 Continuation
Testers -> ITR1 and ITR4 calculation testing along with overall changes testing

ITR4 is priority

Explain the work
ITR2 Clarification mail
ITR4 Issue to see
ITR7 Schema to complete

Talk to ayushi regarding ITR2 Clarifications


Autopopulated fields can be put into required category
Schedule A remaining - Need to see the notified form and draft form

the dropdown field in the utilities have to be protected against import - the validation must contains a check against the database values


Send ITR2 23-24 for calculations
Send itr6 170A for Calculations 
Develop the Pincode code and implement it in all the utilities

Don't populate the state,
Don't clean the pincode when state is being filled
If duplicate pincode is there, Allow to change the state only if it is the one of two
The pincode will not get cleaned or state change will be allowed only in duplicate

If UCase(Trim(ValueOfPerquisitesNature_Salary(cntr, j))) = "TAX PAID BY EMPLOYER ON NON-MONETARY PERQUISITE" Then ValueOfPerquisitesNature_Salary(cntr, j) = "17"
