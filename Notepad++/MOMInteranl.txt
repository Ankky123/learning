Task should not be taken up by individual himself. Complete the task that is assigned.
sanket, roshini, shubham to screen JIRA Issues 
roshini and sanket will try to resolve the issues before assigning (this is for faster exposure to the Rules and DE and requirements)
10 tickets per day per person -> At least 2 of them can be solved by roshini and sanket individually
Excel document -> a new "assigner" and a "Comment" column

Screening Process for JIRA issues
-------
Lets say any issue is picked up by Roshini, 
enter
	Rule no., SIT ID, FY, others...
Defect status -> Fixed, Invalid, Open
If fixed by Roshini -> "Resolved by" is also Roshini
	if not solved -> Status to be kept Open/Invalid
--------
The issues will then be taken up by team leaders.

Team members will not ask their doubts randomly, they will keep a list and a meeting will be scheduled with the team leader for doubt resolutio
Ishita Meeting with team for doubt resolution -> 2 PM
Chirag Meeting with team for doubt resolution -> 2:30 PM
Ankit Meeting with team for doubt resolution -> 3PM


Task whatever is assigned is to be completed,
Extra task not to be taken up until emergency tasks come up which will mostly be given by Rishabh, Nivedita
What will be the impact of the emergency task on other tasks to be shared in advance
Some communications or doubts resolving can take time, so remember to include it in the task list, to avoid overloading on team leader

Teams leads will not explain the testing process to testers, Nishi will take a session to explain them how to test.
If a utility is going for testing (Internal) then a json will go along with it which will be valid against schema 

Ankit Team -> Sanket, Satyaprakash, Roshni, Shubham

Testers now know the sanity of VF, they will now do it.
