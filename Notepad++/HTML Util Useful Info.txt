Functionality of the Utility Code
1. common-function-service.ts -> It works for common components like (Upload JSON, Upload Prefil, all the pages that come before dashboard of a particular ITR)
	Function Eg -> getPaanAndNameFromPrefillJson() -> This extracts pan from the prefill/import json. This pan can then be used by further processing.
2. config-service.ts -> Functions consisting end points for API Calls
	Function Eg -> login, Validation, 
3. json.service.ts -> This is used to generate internal JSON which stores the user data and also further exportes back to UI.
					-> Also contains the functions that are used in change map
	Function eg -> getData -> Is used to get the data from JSON for the passed elementID.
4. map.service.ts -> Functions used to show data or do other operations on data for components present in the angular library.
	Function eg -> showData -> It will load the JSON data in the elementID format
					addObject, addArrayitem -> these are the events in form of HTML buttons
5. root.service.ts -> All the variables present which were used in common components workflow such as pan number input, selected ITR, selected status etc.
6. static-map-ITR2.constants.ts -> This consist of the static map generated by createUIMap and is stored in a variable staticmapITRx. where x represents the ITR.
7. change-map-ITR2.service.ts -> This service consist of changeMapITR2 variable which is a map consisting value such a changeValidation, saveValidation for each 	element present in the ruleAuthor.

JS methods
.includes() -> This method is a JavaScript method that is used to check if a specific string or element is present in another string or array.
.hasOwnProperty() -> This method in JavaScript is used to check whether the object has the specified property as its own property. 
JSON.parse() -> When receiving data from a web server, the data is always a string. Parse the data with JSON.parse(), and the data becomes a JavaScript object.
.getTime() -> This returns the number of milliseconds since January 1, 1970 00:00:00.
pattern.test(text) -> The test() method tests for a match in a string. If it finds a match, it returns true, otherwise it returns false.
array.slice(-1) -> Will return the last element of the array
querySelectorAll() -> The Document method querySelectorAll() returns a static (not live) NodeList representing a list of the document's elements that match the specified group of selectors.

Formula type 3 will be triggered in the end only (used when the element is not present in the utility but required as per schema also it is not affected by any 
	other elements) hence during the final generation of the json, the formula of the field will be called to set the computed value.
	
Formula type 1 will be triggered only on change of the element by which the current field is affected.

unique([[]], [], [])
Argument 1 will be an array of array, every internal array is a group representing that only 1 option of that group will be allowed to be selected
Argument 2 will be an array which represents the options that are allowed to be repeated
Argument 3 will be an array which represents what all the options are to be displayed.
to give nil argument, use "NA"


FURTHER IMPROVEMENTS SUGGESTIONS FOR UTILITY
Dynamic error message -> That uses variable to show any desired value in the display
Pop Up facility
Field to be autopopulated and User Enterable at the same time (for limiting the value but not telling the exact limit)
Multiple pattern to be given, Availability of string methods/int methods -> kind of provided
Customizable decimal limit
Note/label easier addition within any object
Warning message to be shown for the autopopulated field (can be merged with pop up facility)

npm run-script start

npm run build (in frontend)

itr-shared -> component -> navbar-offline-utility (for updating build version)
itr-online -> en.json

createUIMap -> branches 
			dev_merge -> this will be used for pulling into the master branches so that the changes can be merged
			master_21_22 -> this will be used for generating output of AY 21-22 (struct difference only)
			master_22_23 -> this will be used for generating output of AY 22-23 (struct difference only)
			master_23_24 -> this will be used for generating output of AY 23-24 (struct difference only)

E-FilingSandbox -> branches
			->internal_merge_sanity -> this will be used for AY 23-24 sanity (Running as online Utility for the live RuleAuthors)
			>internal_merge_sanity_22_23 -> this will be used for AY 23-24 sanity (Running as online Utility for the live RuleAuthors)

AutoUpdater document for yesterday's discussion with Rishabh---

1. clone itrautoupgrade
2. clone itdofflineutilityv17
3. there are two config.json in itrautoupgrade/installer 1 for dev and 1 for prod.
4. encrypt both, keep prod for installer and dev for itdofflineutilityv17
5.  make sure you are using node 20 and angular 17 for this
6. install node modules using npm i in both repos
7. run "npm run build" for itrautoupgrade in frontend folder and then "wails build" in root folder
8. run "npm run build itr-shared" and then "npm run build-itr-1-4-2023" in itdoff folder/frontend
9. do "wails build" in itdoffline folder
10. copy exe files to installer folder of itrautoupgrade
11. check wxs and make installer


there are two config.json in itrautoupgrade/installer 1 for dev and 1 for prod.(environment="development" vs environment="production" is the only difference)
update the config.json as required in both dev and prod for AY and ITR
use ./encrypter <input-file-name> <output-file-name>
Save the encrypted development json as config.data into itrOfflineUtiltiyV17 folder
Save the production as config.data in installer folder for building installer
